## /rule

Early Launch Antimalware, Boot-Start Driver Initialization Policy must prevent boot drivers identified as bad.

## /description

[**VulnDiscussion**]{.separator type='STIG'}

Compromised boot drivers can introduce malware prior to protection mechanisms that load after initialization. The Early Launch Antimalware driver can limit allowed drivers based on classifications determined by the malware protection application. At a minimum, drivers determined to be bad must not be allowed.

[**Documentable**]{.separator type='STIG'}

false

## /implementations/0/description

The default behavior is for Early Launch Antimalware - Boot-Start Driver Initialization policy to enforce "Good, unknown and bad but critical" (preventing "bad").

If this needs to be corrected or a more secure setting is desired, configure the policy value for Computer Configuration >> Administrative Templates >> System >> Early Launch Antimalware >> "Boot-Start Driver Initialization Policy" to "Not Configured" or "Enabled" with any option other than "All" selected.
