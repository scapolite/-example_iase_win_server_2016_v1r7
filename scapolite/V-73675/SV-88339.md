## /rule

Anonymous access to Named Pipes and Shares must be restricted.

## /description

[**VulnDiscussion**]{.separator type='STIG'}

Allowing anonymous access to named pipes or shares provides the potential for unauthorized system access. This setting restricts access to those defined in "Network access: Named Pipes that can be accessed anonymously" and "Network access: Shares that can be accessed anonymously", both of which must be blank under other requirements.

[**Documentable**]{.separator type='STIG'}
