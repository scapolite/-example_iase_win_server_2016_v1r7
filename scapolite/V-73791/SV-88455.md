## /rule

The Lock pages in memory user right must not be assigned to any groups or accounts.

## /description

[**VulnDiscussion**]{.separator type='STIG'}

Inappropriate granting of user rights can provide system, administrative, and other high-level capabilities.

The "Lock pages in memory" user right allows physical memory to be assigned to processes, which could cause performance issues or a denial of service.
