## /rule

Software certificate installation files must be removed from Windows Server 2016.

## /description

[**VulnDiscussion**]{.separator type='STIG'}

Use of software certificates and their accompanying installation files for end users to access resources is less secure than the use of hardware-based certificates.

[**Documentable**]{.separator type='STIG'}

false

## /implementations/0/description

Remove any certificate installation files (*.p12 and *.pfx) found on a system.

This does not apply to server-based applications that have a requirement for certificate files.
