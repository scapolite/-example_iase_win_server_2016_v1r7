## /rule

The Deny log on as a service user right must be configured to include no accounts or groups (blank) on domain controllers.

## /description

[**VulnDiscussion**]{.separator type='STIG'}

Inappropriate granting of user rights can provide system, administrative, and other high-level capabilities.

The "Deny log on as a service" user right defines accounts that are denied logon as a service.

Incorrect configurations could prevent services from starting and result in a denial of service.

## /implementations/0/description

Configure the policy value for Computer Configuration >> Windows Settings >> Security Settings >> Local Policies >> User Rights Assignment >> "Deny log on as a service" to include no entries (blank).
