## /rule

The LAN Manager authentication level must be set to send NTLMv2 response only and to refuse LM and NTLM.

## /description

[**VulnDiscussion**]{.separator type='STIG'}

The Kerberos v5 authentication protocol is the default for authentication of users who are logging on to domain accounts. NTLM, which is less secure, is retained in later Windows versions for compatibility with clients and servers that are running earlier versions of Windows or applications that still use it. It is also used to authenticate logons to standalone computers that are running later versions.

Configure the policy value for Computer Configuration >> Windows Settings >> Security Settings >> Local Policies >> Security Options >> "Network security: LAN Manager authentication level" to "Send NTLMv2 response only. Refuse LM &amp; NTLM".
