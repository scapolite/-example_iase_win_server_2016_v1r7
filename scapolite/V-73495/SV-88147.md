## /rule

Local administrator accounts must have their privileged token filtered to prevent elevated privileges from being used over the network on domain systems.

## /description

[**VulnDiscussion**]{.separator type='STIG'}

A compromised local administrator account can provide means for an attacker to move laterally between domain systems.

With User Account Control enabled, filtering the privileged token for local administrator accounts will prevent the elevated privileges of these accounts from being used over the network.

false

## /implementations/0/description

Configure the policy value for Computer Configuration >> Administrative Templates >> MS Security Guide >> "Apply UAC restrictions to local accounts on network logons" to "Enabled".

This policy setting requires the installation of the SecGuide custom templates included with the STIG package. "SecGuide.admx" and " SecGuide.adml" must be copied to the \Windows\PolicyDefinitions and \Windows\PolicyDefinitions\en-US directories respectively.
