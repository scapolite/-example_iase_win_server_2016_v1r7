## /rule

AutoPlay must be disabled for all drives.

## /description

[**VulnDiscussion**]{.separator type='STIG'}

Allowing AutoPlay to execute may introduce malicious code to a system. AutoPlay begins reading from a drive as soon media is inserted into the drive. As a result, the setup file of programs or music on audio media may start. By default, AutoPlay is disabled on removable drives, such as the floppy disk drive (but not the CD-ROM drive) and on network drives. Enabling this policy disables AutoPlay on all drives.
