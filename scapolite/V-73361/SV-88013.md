## /rule

The Kerberos service ticket maximum lifetime must be limited to 600 minutes or less.

## /description

[**VulnDiscussion**]{.separator type='STIG'}

This setting determines the maximum amount of time (in minutes) that a granted session ticket can be used to access a particular service. Session tickets are used only to authenticate new connections with servers. Ongoing operations are not interrupted if the session ticket used to authenticate the connection expires during the connection.

Satisfies: SRG-OS-000112-GPOS-00057, SRG-OS-000113-GPOS-00058

## /implementations/0/description

Configure the policy value in the Default Domain Policy for Computer Configuration >> Policies >> Windows Settings >> Security Settings >> Account Policies >> Kerberos Policy >> "Maximum lifetime for service ticket" to a maximum of "600" minutes, but not "0", which equates to "Ticket doesn't expire".
