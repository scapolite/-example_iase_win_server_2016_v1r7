## /rule

The DoD Interoperability Root CA cross-certificates must be installed in the Untrusted Certificates Store on unclassified systems.

## /description

[**VulnDiscussion**]{.separator type='STIG'}

To ensure users do not experience denial of service when performing certificate-based authentication to DoD websites due to the system chaining to a root other than DoD Root CAs, the DoD Interoperability Root CA cross-certificates must be installed in the Untrusted Certificate Store. This requirement only applies to unclassified systems.
